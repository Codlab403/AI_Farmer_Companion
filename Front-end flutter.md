 **Detailed, structured plan for the front-end development** of the **AI Farmer’s Companion app**, focused on building a multilingual, offline-capable, voice-and-text interface using **Flutter** (ideal for Android + PWA deployment). This setup works well with modern AI workflows and is developer-friendly for agents like Cursor and Windsurf.

## 🌐 **Frontend Development Plan**

### 📱 1. **Framework & Project Setup**

#### ✅ Stack:

- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (stable release)
    
- **Language**: Dart
    
- **Target Platforms**:
    
    - Android (APK)
        
    - Progressive Web App (PWA)
        
    - Future: iOS
        

#### 🔧 Setup Tasks:

-  Install Flutter + SDK + Android Studio / VSCode
    
-  Initialize project with `flutter create ai_farmers_companion`
    
-  Set up CI/CD via GitHub Actions (optional)
    

---

### 🧱 2. **App Architecture & Structure**

Use a modular folder structure for maintainability and AI agent support:

```
/lib
  /screens
  /widgets
  /models
  /services
  /voice
  /localization
  main.dart
/assets
  /images
  /audio
  /translations
```

Use state management with:

- **Riverpod** (recommended for scale & testability)
    
- OR simple **Provider** for smaller MVP
    

---

### 🌍 3. **Multilingual & Accessibility Support**

#### 🌐 Languages:

- Amharic (`am`)
    
- Afaan Oromo (`om`)
    
- Somali (`so`)
    
- English (`en`)
    

#### 📌 Tasks:

-  Use `flutter_localizations` + `intl`
    
-  Add .arb translation files under `/assets/translations/`
    
-  Build a language switcher dropdown (onboarding + settings)
    

---

### 🗂️ 4. **UI Screens & Components**

Design for **low literacy, touch-first, offline-friendly UX**.

#### ✅ Key Screens:

|Screen|Description|
|---|---|
|Home|Tile-based quick access to core features|
|Ask AI|Chat screen with text + mic button|
|Crop Guide|Calendar view, region-specific tips|
|Pest Photo Upload|Image picker + submit to server|
|Settings|Language toggle, sync info, help guide|
|Offline Alert|Banner or popup when offline|

#### 🔧 Core Widgets:

- `VoiceButton()` (hold-to-record with animation)
    
- `MessageBubble()` (for AI and user in chat)
    
- `TileButton()` (icon + label navigation)
    
- `SyncBanner()` (shows last sync, warns if outdated)
    

#### UX Guidelines:

- Use large touch targets
    
- Use icons and illustrations with text
    
- Use scrollable cards for market/weather data
    

---

### 🔊 5. **Voice I/O Integration**

#### 🔍 Input:

- Use [`speech_to_text`](https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text)
    
- Fallback to offline Whisper via local server (optional)
    

#### 🔉 Output:

- Use [`flutter_tts`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tts)
    
- Configure for Amharic, Afaan Oromo if supported (or upload audio files)
    

---

### 🌐 6. **Offline Capability & Sync**

Use local storage for offline-first approach:

-  Store crop data, guides, FAQs in **SQLite** (`sqflite`)
    
-  Sync market/weather info daily (if connected)
    
-  Track last-sync timestamp & notify user
    

Cache voice/text history and allow retry when online.

---

### 🔄 7. **API Integration Points**

#### Gemini AI:

- Text: Gemini Pro API via backend (`/chat`)
    
- Voice: Use Whisper frontend → backend transcription → Gemini
    
- Image: Backend receives image, returns response to UI
    

#### Local Ollama (Optional for dev):

- Allow local dev to test Llama 3.2 response in place of cloud AI
    

---

### 🧪 8. **Testing & QA Plan**

-  Device testing: 3G Android phones (multiple brands)
    
-  Language switch testing (RTL + non-Latin scripts)
    
-  Voice performance with accents and background noise
    
-  Offline mode scenarios (turn off data)
    

Use `flutter_test`, integration tests, and manual scenario testing.

---

### 🚀 9. **Deployment Plan**

-  Generate APK for field devices
    
-  Configure for PWA (in `web/`)
    
-  Deploy PWA to Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages (for dev testing)

Would you like me to generate:

- Flutter widget code templates?
    
- YAML + `.arb` translations to get started?
    
- API integration boilerplate (Gemini or local)?
    

Let me know — I can provide plug-and-play starter files.
